# gxit_2025

A new Flutter project.

# Flutter App Build Issue Resolution

## Problem
The app was experiencing build issues when attempting to deploy to the Google Play Store:

1. **Package Name Restrictions**: Google Play Store doesn't allow apps with `com.example` package names
2. **Firebase Configuration**: Changing package name affected Firebase configuration
3. **Kotlin Version Compatibility**: Outdated Kotlin version causing issues with Firebase dependencies
4. **SDK Compatibility**: Outdated compileSdk version not compatible with dependencies

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Updated Kotlin Version
- Updated Kotlin plugin from `1.8.22` to `2.0.0` in `settings.gradle.kts` to ensure compatibility with Firebase dependencies

### 2. Updated SDK Versions
- Changed `compileSdk` to version 35 in `android/app/build.gradle.kts`
- Set appropriate JVM target compatibility to Java 11

### 3. Package Name Configuration
- Used a dual approach for package name handling:
  - Kept `namespace = "com.example.gxit_2025"` for internal code organization and Firebase compatibility
  - Set `applicationId = "com.gxit.app"` for Google Play Store identification

### 4. Firebase Configuration
- Updated `google-services.json` to include multiple client entries:
  - Original package name: `com.example.gxit_2025`
  - Play Store package name: `com.gxit.app`

### 5. Simplified Build Configuration
- Removed product flavors to simplify the build process
- Disabled minification and shrinking temporarily to troubleshoot build issues

## Build Commands
To rebuild the app after these changes:
```
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build appbundle
```

## Note for Future Deployments
If you need to update the package name again, remember to:
1. Update both `applicationId` in `build.gradle.kts`
2. Add the new package name to Firebase console
3. Update the `google-services.json` file with the new client configuration
